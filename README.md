# Patch Notes 

## Overlord: Farming
Prepare to get busy! The new update - Overlord: Farming is over 5x larger than Puzzles & Authority combined!*

Featuring:

### Crop Design
Pick from 8 different diverse crops (2 pre-unlocked) to grow. These crops can be collected when ready in a time frame; to be sold for cash for upgrades/unlocks.

### Expansion
Use the shop to expand your plots, to grow different crops at one time, or just gain the maximum effect.

### Technologies
Leveling up your farm is easy - Collect crops and automatically gain experience. Upgrade Crop Efficiency for chance to gain multiplicative drops!

### Government Intervention
Investigators may start getting suspicious on what you're doing. Use provided tools to throw them off your trail or give into their pesky demand and 'promise' to not do it again!
